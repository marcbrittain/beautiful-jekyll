### Brief Notes

Current senior at the University of North Carolina Wilmington pursuing a B.S. Degree in Physics, along with a minor in mathematics. My interests are in the field of Aerospace Engineering, which is route I plan to take in my post undergraduate career. The goal of this website is to share my current work so that others can become inspired by the opportunities that computing can bring to the scientific setting. I have also included a tutorial section to highlight different topics that I feel are important in learning a computing language. I want to thank you for visiting this site, and if you have any questions feel free to contact me at the email provided above.

### Brief Notes

Current student at Iowa State Univerity pursuing a PhD in Aerospace Engineering. The goal of this website is to share my current work so that others can become inspired by the opportunities that computing can bring to the scientific setting. I have also included a tutorial section to highlight different topics that I feel are important in learning a computing language. I want to thank you for visiting this site, and if you have any questions feel free to contact me at the email provided above.
